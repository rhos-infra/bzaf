About bzaf
=================

``bzaf`` is a python based `Bugzilla <https://www.bugzilla.org/>`_ auto verification tool.

``bzaf``'s main goal is to provide a robust auto verification workflow while
focusing on ease-of-use and simplicity.

``bzaf`` operates by executing auto-verification commands found in a bugzilla
comment to try to verify the said bz.

``bzaf's`` power comes into play when integrated into CI environments, to
create an auto-verification cycle.
